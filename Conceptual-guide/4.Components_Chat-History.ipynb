    "The concept of ChatHistory refers to a class in LangChain which can be used to wrap an arbitrary chain. This ChatHistory will keep track of inputs and outputs of the underlying chain, and append them as messages to a message database. Future interactions will then load those messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input.\n",
